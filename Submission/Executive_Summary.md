## 1. Food Search
### Description  
The Food Search feature allows users to quickly find comprehensive nutritional information about specific food items. Users enter the food name, and the system retrieves all relevant nutritional data. 

The functionality of this feature works by comparing the string the user enters in the input box to the data within the 'food' column of our data frame, returning any entries that match the query, and updating the data frame that we display. 

*(This feature is accomplished through the use of pandas and str.contains())*

### Steps
1. The User begins typing in the input box (Search).
2. The program compares the string entered in the input box to strings in the 'food' column and returns a newly updated data frame.
3. The list of food has now shrunk and narrowed down to meet the users search input.
