### Brief Description of Contribution

Please Describe what you have accomplished in this group project.

- S5384822, Kane Bebb
  - Accomplishments: In the project plan section, I created the [Project Objectives](#11-project-objectives) and [Project Scope](#13-project-scope) sections. In the software design doc I created the [Problem Background](./Software%20Design%20Document.md#11-problem-background), [System Capabilities/Overview](./Software%20Design%20Document.md#12-system-capabilitiesoverview), [Benefit Analysis](./Software%20Design%20Document.md#13-benefit-analysis), and [Visual Design](./Software%20Design%20Document.md#42-visual-design) sections. I also collaborated with Nick to complete the [Structural Design](./Software%20Design%20Document.md#41-structural-design).
  - <r> For Milestone 2, I worked on the implementation of the search features, including all the filters required to display results. I also worked on updating the User Interface to reflect the requirements of these filters from what Nick had already created.</r>
- s5350818, Nick Bland
  - In the project plan section, I created the [WBS](#2-work-breakdown-structure), [Activity Definitions](#3-activity-definition-estimation), and [Gantt Chart](#4-gantt-chart).
  - In the software design section, I created the [Software Design and System Components](./Software%20Design%20Document.md#3-software-design-and-system-components) as well as collaborating on the [Structural Design](./Software%20Design%20Document.md#41-structural-design) for the project. 
  - <r>For Milestone 2, I created the User interface for most components. I also worked on implementing the food screen and comparison panel to display more in-depth information about foods selected.</r>
- s5403634, Cameron Cassar
  - In the software design section, I created the [Requirements](./Software%20Design%20Document.md#2-requirements), [User Requirements](./Software%20Design%20Document.md#21-user-requirements), [Software Requirements](./Software%20Design%20Document.md#22-software-requirements), [Use Case Diagrams](./Software%20Design%20Document.md#23-use-case-diagram), [Use Cases](./Software%20Design%20Document.md#24-use-cases),
  - In the project plan section, I created the [Project Stakeholders](#12-project-stakeholders).
  - <r>For Milestone 2, I worked on documentation and updates to previously made documentation in Milestone 1.</r>

### 1.1 Project Objectives  

**'Project Objectives'** refers to the **goals** that we will attempt to achieve during the life-cycle of the project. These **goals** include meeting quality standards and stakeholder satisfaction; paired alongside are **objectives** such as "Intuitive UI design" which speaks a goal of setting and consistently meeting our high quality standards.

<ins>_General Project Objectives/Needs_: </ins>

- Create an innovative and invaluable tool that satisfies the standards set by stakeholders.
- Complete the project with minimal delay and within the pre-planned schedule.
- Create an intuitive UI (user interface) that feels natural and comfortable for users to interact with.
- Adhere to stakeholder specifications and meet expectations of both the stakeholders and our customers/users.
- Maintain the scope of the project throughout it's lifecycle; paying close attention to stay within bounds.
- Create an application that meets the needs of a user base interested in analysing data, specifically food-based data. Such as: Dietitians, Nutritionists, Health-conscious individuals, and Meal Planners.

<ins>_Stakeholder Objectives/Needs_: </ins>

- Create an app that fulfills the required specifications I.E: Input database **&rarr;** manipulate data **&rarr;** output/display data in interesting ways (graphs etc.)
- The app will meet the following stakeholder requirements/specifications (functionally): Food Search, Nutrition Breakdown, Nutrition Range Filter, Nutrition Level Filter, and one extra additional feature chosen by developers (Food Comparison).

## 4. Gantt Chart

The Gantt Chart is used to show current developmental progress on the project. It uses the planned activities from [Section 3](#3-activity-definition-estimation), which in turn were developed in [Section 2](#2-work-breakdown-structure).

![Gantt Chart](./Gantt_chart.png)
<r>Updated Gantt Chart to reflex activities that have been completed in both Milestone 1 and Milestone 2. Importantly, the closing process was not a part of this assessment</r>
